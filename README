=========================================

1) Open a file using the 'open file' button.

2) Make changes to your video using the tools available in
the editor panel.
You can hover over each of the buttons to get more information.

3) When you are satisified with the edits you have made, save your video to a suitable location using 'save file' button.

- At any point you can change the skin with 'Select Skin' button.
- The Overlay Panel to the right of the screen will be updated with what edits you have made. This is not representative of the final product. This isn't even its final form.
- The future overlay panel will have
	> a selectable table of edits
	> a 'Modify Edit' button and a 'Delete Edit' button
	> a 'Commit Overlay' button.
